# Original Storyline, by [KajiSensei] & [Ellypse]

# Tired of the ugly original quest frame ?

This addon aims to enhance the readability and immersion when questing in World of Warcraft. It adds a brand new quest frame, with animated models and fancy effects.
If you like to read all quests and are a fan of the World of Warcraft lore, this addon is for you !

# What is it, exactly?

Storyline provides a new quest frame, that panel appearing when you get a quest from a NPC. World of Warcraft UI improved over the years but one thing Blizzard never touched is this hideous Quest frame. We wanted to have a quest frame inspired by the garrison frames dynamism.
Storyline frame adds 3D animated models for you and your quest giver. Also it "cuts" the dialogue into multiple parts, playing one after another in an old-school RPG style. Finally it adds more effects and visuals to express objectives and rewards.
